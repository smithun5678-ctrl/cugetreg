## The beginning of CU Get Reg

    "Which GenEd courses should I enroll this semester?"

    "Will this course conflict with my other courses?"

    "Each section of this course is taught on different days. How do I choose?"

And many other problems students face when planning their timetable for the semester. We, the CU Get Reg team, are no different.

Picking courses and sections in each semester is a very complicated and time-consuming process. Course information is scattered, especially GenEd courses. When trying to find the right GenEd, you have to consider many factors such as course contents, available seats, and popularity. However, that information is hard to access which makes planning very difficult.

We saw this problem and built [CU Get Reg](https://cugetreg.com) to make this planning process a breeze!
